  <h1>Education</h1>
  <div class="edu">
      <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>I chose Software Engineering as my major after bouncing around from Education and Mathematics. It was actually in my Introduction to Computer Science class that I found excitement in what I was doing and started doing side projects and looking forward to the next thing I would learn. I knew then that this was the field I really wanted to enter.</p>
      <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <p>I used to be a Mathematics major before I switched to Software Engineering. I was meeting with the academic advisor for the College of Engineering to declare a minor in Computer Science and we started talking about the different ways I could go about doing this. In the end I decided that it would be better for me to major in Software Engineering and minor in Mathematics.</p>
      <h2>Software Engineering Club</h2>
      <p>I joined the Software Engineering club in Fall of 2018, joining in after the 1st meeting. Usually I am not able to attend the entire meeting because I have my calculus class during most of the meeting time. I usually still stop by to talk to people, work on projects, and see what the meeting was about. I consider the Software Engineering Club to be a great educational resource as well as being fun. If I have any problems with my projects there is always someone there to help out and the meeting usually has a lot of information about new software, exciting opportunites and any upcoming programming events.</p>
      <h2>SWFL Coders</h2>
      <p>The SWFL Coders is professional organization that puts on different programming events to introduce new topics and ideas in software to people working or studying in the field. The most recent meeting we had was about software architecture and its role in communicating our ideas to others. We spoke of the Gang of Four, the three groups of 23 basic patterns and how similarly they are implemented among different programming languages. The SWFL Coders group is a great networking and learning opportunity.</p>
