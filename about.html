	<p class="about">My name is Elizabeth and I'm a mathematics student at FGCU working towards becoming a data analyst. I like making websites and nitpicking my coworker's file-naming conventions. I live in Lehigh Acres, Florida with my mom, three younger siblings and two adorable puppies named Bailey and Emma.I currently work as a medical records clerk but once I get my A+ certification I hope to start working as tech support for the same company.</p>
	
	<p class="about">In my spare time I tutor middle and high school students in math and science, play Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons, and read books on theoretical physics and math. </p>
