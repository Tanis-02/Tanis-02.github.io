	<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
	
	<p class="about">My name is Elizabeth and I'm a Software Engineering student at FGCU working towards becoming a software developer. I like playing around with website code and nitpicking my coworker's file-naming conventions to pass the time. I live in Lehigh Acres, Florida with my mom, three younger siblings and two adorable puppies named Bailey and Emma.I currently work as a refunds coordinator for 21st Century Oncology but once I get my A+ certification I hope to start working as tech support for the same company.</p>
	
	<h2>Professional Classes and Clubs</h2>
	<p class="about">I have only recenctly made the switch from a Mathematics major to a Software Engineering major. So far the only Software Engineering class I have taken is the one I am currently in: <em>Introduction to Computer Science</em>. I am registered for <em>Introduction to Programming</em> for the Spring 2019 semester and will take <em>Programming Methodology</em> in the Summer 2019. I am a part of the Software Engineering club at Florida Gulf Coast University and try to make it to every meeting, often making the end of the meeting due to my class schedule. I also attend events held by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SWFL-Coders/?_cookie-check=HRkdIHISRrRbscux" target="_blank">SWFL Coders</a> which is an organization created for Software professionals and enthusists. The hold meets/events once a month to present new software and ideas in software development. I also attend events help by the <a href="http://www.swfrtp.org/" target="_blank">Southwest Florida Regional Technology Partnership</a>, like their Raspberry Pi event where we programmed Raspberry Pi's to create an entertainment system.</p>
	
	<h2>Nerdy Hobbies</h2>
	<p class="about">I have a variety of hobbies which might be described by some to be sterotypically nerdy and not conducive to breaking the sterotype of computer people as super nerds. That being said, I don't care becasuse I'm having fun. I play Magic the Gathering on Friday nights until midngight, Dungeons and Dragons on Sundays for 8 hours like it's my job, and read both fantasy and non-fiction books for fun.</p>
