      <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <p>I used to be a Mathematics major before I switched to Software Engineering. I was meeting with the academic advisor for the College of Engineering to declare a minor in Computer Science and we started talking about the different ways I could go about doing this. In the end I decided that it would be better for me to major in Software Engineering and minor in Mathematics.</p>
      <h2>Software Engineering Club</h2>
      <p>I joined the Software Engineering club in Fall of 2018, joining in after the 1st meeting. Usually I am not able to attend the entire meeting because I have my calculus class during most of the meeting time. I usually still stop by the talk to people, work on project, and see what the meeting was about. I consider the Software Engineering Club to be a great educational resource as well as being fun. If I have any problems with my projects there is always someone there to help out and the meeting usually has a lot of information about new software, exciting opportunites and any upcoming programming events.</p>
