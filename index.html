	  <h3>Hacktoberfest 2018</h3>
	  <img src="./images/hacktoberfest_logo.png" alt="Hacktoberfest Logo">
	  <p>I participated for the first time in the 2018 Hacktoberfest! I made 6 pull requets for simple HTML problems to get used to contributing to opensourced projects and learn how to properly use GitHub. I had a lot of fun and it really motivated me to learn more programming languages so that I can contribute more to this event, and others like it, next year.</p>

    <h3>Field Report</h3>

	  <p>One of the assignment for my Intro to Computer Science class was to create a report on the differences between Computer Science and Software Engineering and the branches of Computer Science. We were supposed to write it as either a letter to your parent/parental-figure or your future employer. I chose to write a letter to my grandmother who is a very old school hispanic woman who's computer experience is limited to Facebook and the bubble popping game.</p>

	    <h3>JavaScript Clock</h3>
	      <p>Using basic javascript and some jquery I created a military time clock. The basics of the clock are getting the date and time from the computer and then getting just the hours, minutes and seconds to show on the HTML page. The last thing I wanted to make sure of was that the clock continued to run past the initial point where the time was being called so I made sure the page refreshed every 1 second and added an extra 0 to the clock when the time was in the single digits. I had help for this project in the form of W3Schools, which provided a reference library for me, and StackOverflow which helped me when I ran into problems with my clock not changing.</p>

        <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
        <img src="./images/scratch.PNG" alt="Image of my Scratch game">
          <p>My Scratch project is a simple catching game where you catch droplets of wine in a wine glass. The purpose of the game was to get familar with boolean logic and basic programming structure without getting into any actual code. </p>
